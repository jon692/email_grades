pre-lab,,2,2,3,4,3,4,2,3,2,"Well, that was the last pre-lab!  I hope that you learned some important pieces of chemistry from doing these pre-labs.  They were not designed to teach you everything or make your labs flawless, but simply to give you one step into the experiment before you stepped foot into the lab.  I saw a lot of progress this semester!  Thank you!  And with that, give a shout of ""hooray!""  We're finished with pre-labs (for the semester)!"
